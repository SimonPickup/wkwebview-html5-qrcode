# wkwebview-html5-qrcode
This is a simple test of [mebjas/html5-qrcode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/) within iOS Swift WKWebView. Apparently this started working in iOS 14.3. See https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/14#issuecomment-768047893 

It basically works, but not pretty.

Caveat: I'm no JavaScript developer.
